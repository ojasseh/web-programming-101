# WP101 - Notes :: Into Programming and Tooling

A. Camara and B. Drammeh - 5th February, 2018.



## Contents

[TOC]

This section will cover the general concepts of programming, what is web programming, the things you need to get started with web programming and how to install them. It also highlight how to deal with files that are associated with the site your are building.



## Programming

Sometimes refers to as **coding**, is the art of writing computer code using a text editor (in our case), an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or other less or advanced tools.



## Web Programming

In short: Is the art of building website and/or web applications.

The people who build websites and/or web applications are often referrers to as web developers, in short developer.

Note: there are a lot names out their but don't worry about that, most of the the time we are all doing the same thing.



## Types of Web Developers

Web programming could be divided into three or more categories. You have the front-end Developers, Back-end Developers and/or Full stack Developers, and many other names.

**Front End** :: The stuff you see on website or web application in your browser. Front End Developers make use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and their relevant frameworks to ensure content is presented effectively and user’s have an excellent experience.

**Back End** :: This refers to the guts of the application which live on the server. They manipulate data appropriately to make sure the Front End has what it needs. This can become very complicated as things scale. Back End Developers make use of programming languages like Node JS, Python, and Ruby (among many others) to work with data.

**Full Stack** :: This is where a developers marry both sides into one. A Full Stack developer can comfortably work with both the front and back ends. This is what we focus on building you up in both level I and II.



## Program

Sometimes referrers to as **code**, is a set instructions that tell the computer what task to do. Those set of instructions must follow a valid **syntax** in order for your program to work properly.



### Syntax

The **rules** for a *valid format and combinations* of instructions for a particular language. Example, in English language you must follow the rules (valid spellings, punctuations etc) of the language for you to be understood.

Similar things, as far as programming languages are concern, you must adhere to the syntax (rules) of the language in order for your code to be executed as intended.



## Executing a Program

In order for a program to tell the computer what to do, it must execute or run that program.

**Interpreters or a Compilers** :: This is a special utility in the computer that translate the code we wrote into a command that the computer can understand. This is because the codes that we write are only helpful to us (programmers) but not the computers, so for the computers to understand that code, it must be translated.

**Interpreting Code** :: The translation is done from top to bottom, line by line, every time the program is run.

**Compiling Code** :: The translation is done ahead of time, so when the code/program runs later, what's running is actually the translated code.

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)** :: HTML is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. HTML is not a programming language, but a Markup Language that is used to structure content.

HTML is executed in the browser. HTML documents (pages) are delivered as "documents". These are then **parsed**, which turns them into the Document Object Model (DOM) internal representation, within the web browser

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** :: CSS is the code you use to style your webpage. Like HTML, CSS is not really a programming language. It is not a *markup language* either — it is a *style sheet language*. This means that it lets you apply styles selectively to elements in HTML documents.

**JavaScript (JS)** :: JS is a dynamic  programming language that adds dynamic interactivity on website as far as client side JS is concern. Here dynamic means: the JavaScript engine actually compiles the program on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code. 



## Tooling

The tools you need in order to get started with programming the web. 

- **A computer (laptop or a desktop)** :: For serious web programming you need computer (Windows, Linux or Mac)

- **A text editor** :: This is where we will write our codes. For this course, we use will Visual Studio Code. There are other text editor like Atom, Brackets and Sublime.

- **Web browsers** :: This is where we will test our code. For this course our primary browser will be Firefox. There are other browsers like Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Opera and Safari.

- **A graphic editor** :: This is where we are going to optimize images for our websites. For this course, we will use Photoshop. There are other graphic editors like Paint and GIMP

- **A version control system** :: This is what we will used to to store your code and also to collaborate on a project with each other, share code and assets and avoid editing conflicts. For this course we will use Git and GitHub.

- **An automation system** :: This is what we use to automatically perform repetitive tasks, such as concatenating our files, minifying our codes and running tests. For this course, we will use Gulp.

- **Libraries and frameworks** :: This is what we will use to speed up writing common functionality. For this course we will use JQuery etc.

## Installations

Installation of the tools mentioned above. follow the links to install the following before our next meetup.



### HTML, CSS and JS

We don't need to install any of these – they come with your web browser already!  Later, you may actually start using JavaScript on your computer as a server-side language (Node.js), in that you will need to install node.js, but for now you’ve got nothing to worry about with these three.



### Text Editor

This course will use visual studio code as it primary text editor. Technically, you can use any other text editor for this course, but visual studio code has many handy and nifty features that will make your coding journey much easier.

Download it from this => [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and watch this video => [how to get up and runing with visual studio code]()



### Web Browsers

Firefox and Chrome are the primary browser we will use for this course. Please follow the links below to download and install Firefox. If you have it installed, please update it to the latest version.

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge)
- [opera](http://www.opera.com/)




### Git and GitHub

Mentioned earlier, Git is a version control system. Please follow the link for instructions on how to install git. Also create a GitHub account 

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) - store your code here




### Local web server

Later in the course, some codes will need to be run through a web server in order to work successfully. please follow the link below to learn how to that.

- [How do you set up a local testing server?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)






## Checklist

Make sure you have the following before moving to the next step

- Installed Visual Studio Code

- Installed or update/Upgrade Firefox, Chrome, MS Edge etc.

- Installed Git

- Create a GitHub account

- Create a Stack Overflow account

- Install Slack (we will send you an invitation to course workspace)

## Attribution

We took heavy inspirations from the following resources when creating these notes.

What is different is, we tried to align problems sets to reinforce prior learning and projects are base on real world websites and/or web applications.

Many of the notes and style of the course were inspired by (or are directly taken from):

- [Getting started with the Web overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) 
- [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) 
- [HTML element - Wikipedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element)
