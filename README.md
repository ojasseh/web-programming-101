# Syllabus - Web Programming 101 (WP101)

Peace, welcome to WP101 (Web Programming 101). This course teaches students how to program the web, using the three fundamental building blocks of the web; HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Topics includes, introduction to the general concepts of programming, Internet and world wide web, design (user-centered, usability and visual design), responsive design, accessibility and performance.

The course also teaches students the basics of Git and how they can deploy their codes to GiHub and/or Surge. Towards the end of the course, students are also introduce to SASS (CSS Pre-processor), Gulp (An automation system), JQuery (JavaScript Library) and a Static Site Generator (Gatsby).

Problems sets and projects are designed around what is happening in the real-world. Designed for anyone who has interest in learning how to code, with or without prior programming experience.

## Lectures

Lectures are recorded on weekly basis, which introduce course's concepts. You can watch them at home on your own time. 

A summary of lectures appears below

| Lecture | Topic                                    |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Week 0  | Into programming and Tooling             |
| Week 1  | Getting Started with HTML and CSS        |
| Week 2  | Command Line Basics, Git and Github Pages and the Internet |
| Week 3  | Multimedia (Audio and Video), HTML Tables, and HTML Forms |
|         |                                          |

## Practice

Lectures are supplemented by weekly practice questions and in class practice sessions (labs), led by Baboucarr Drammeh and the teaching fellows. Practice sessions are an opportunity to discuss the course's materials in depth, ask questions when you get stuck with you code and get all your doubts cleared about any code and/or concepts.

A summary of practice problems  appears below. 

| Practice   |                                          | Language     |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Practice 1 | Practice 1.1 - Profile Page<br />Practice 1.2 - Story Page | HTML and CSS |
| ...        |                                          |              |



## Reading Assignments

Assigned readings gives students the opportunity to go beyond this class and read much superior materials that are beyond the scope of this course. **Note**: text and exam questions might be drawn from the required reading assignments.



## Quizzes

Weekly quizzes checks your understanding of the notes and/or reading assignments.They should be printed and solved via pen/pencil and submit them before lectures. No quizzes will be accepted after 30mins of lectures.

A summary of problem sets appears below. 

| Quizzes   | Topic                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Quizzes 0 | Into Programming and Web programming |
| Quizzes 1 | HTML and CSS                         |
| ...       |                                      |



## Test

There will be a (take-home) test at the end of HTML and CSS and another one after completion of JavaScript. These tests checks mastery on each area and prepare you for the final exam.



## Exam

At the end of the course, there will be a final Exam to synthesize and assesse mastery of the entire course material.



## Walkthroughs

Integrated into problem sets are 'walkthroughs' videos that offer direction on where to begin and how to approach problem sets and project/s.



## Problem Sets

Problem sets will be issued a week ahead before lectures. There are always two or more problem sets, the first one is always mandatory and the rest are optional.

A summary of problem sets appears below. 

| Problem Set   |                                          | Language     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Problem Set 0 | Install all the tools mention in notes-0 | Installation |
| Problem Set 1 | Biography Page 1.1 <br />Tribute Page 1.2 | HTML and CSS |
| ...           |                                          |              |



## Solutions

Available after problem sets' deadlines are Solutions, which the Baboucarr Drammeh will explore actual solutions to problem sets. You are expected to be in class for insights into how else you could have (or should have!) implemented your own solutions.



## Hackathon

Towards the end of this course, we will have a 2 day Hackathon, an epic all day during which each team can dive into their final project's implementation alongside classmates, other students from other institutions, Instructors and teaching fellows. If your team choose to partake, they will be asked to propose three milestones for that morning: a "good" one that they intend to achieve no matter what; a "better" one that they think they can achieve; and a "best" one that they hope to achieve.



## Final Project

All final projects will solve an actual problem, that have an impact in our community. Each team will strive to create something that outlives this course.

Development is rarely a one-person effort, you are allowed an opportunity to collaborate with two (min) or four (max) classmates for this final project.

Guidelines for the final project will be release towards the end of the course.



## Course Fair

At the end of this course we will have Course Fair, an epic display of final projects. Not only is the fair a venue at which to see classmates, projects and demo your own, it is an opportunity to mingle with students from other institutions, faculty, and staff as well as recruiters from industry. Attendance is expected of all students. Family and friends are welcome to join.



## Academic Honesty

The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course's material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.

The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you or giving you a copy of his work. 

Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy. 

Collaboration on test and exam is not permitted at all. Collaboration on the course's final project is permitted to the extent prescribed by its specification.

If anyone goes beyond the terms stated in this policy on any of the problem sets, test, exam and project/s, both of you will get zero for that item, regard less of who copied who.



## Attributions

We took heavy inspirations from the following resources when creating these notes.  On each weekly notes there will be an attribution where we took inspirations from. 

What is different is, we tried to align problems sets to reinforce prior learning and projects are base on real world websites and/or web applications.

Many of the notes and style of the course were inspired by (or are directly taken from):

- [Getting started with the Web overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) - Mozilla Developer Network
- [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/)

- [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
- [p1xt-guides](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/) - The most useful all in one guides

The design of the course syllabus and/or format of the course materials were inspired by (or are directly taken from):

- [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) David J. Malan of Harvard University
